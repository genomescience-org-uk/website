Please join us at **Genome Science UK**, this summer at Newcastle University. This ever-popular genomic technologies and applications conference will be held at The Frederick Douglas Centre, from 9th - 11th July 2025. 

## Newcastle

Nestled in the heart of northeast England, Newcastle upon Tyne is a vibrant, innovative city that offers the perfect setting for Genome Science UK. Home to **Newcastle University**, a leading institution in biological and life sciences research, the city fosters cutting-edge discoveries in everything from genetics and microbiology to environmental science and biotechnology.

With a compact city centre, excellent public transport, and world-renowned research hubs like the **Centre for Life** and the **NIHR Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre**, Newcastle offers seamless connectivity between academia, healthcare, and industry.

But science isn’t all you’ll find here. Newcastle’s stunning blend of Georgian architecture, the scenic Quayside by the River Tyne, and its famously warm Geordie welcome create a uniquely inspiring backdrop for collaboration and discovery.
